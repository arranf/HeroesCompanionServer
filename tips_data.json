For instance, if the enemy team composition features lots of Slowing effects, choose  Purifying Darts, whereas  Smelling Salts excels against Stun heavy Heroes.","Due to her limited self-healing capabilities, Ana needs to pay special attention on where she positions herself during a team fight.","Nano Boost's duration of 8 seconds is quite long, so do not be too hesitant to cast it at the beginning of a team fight.","Use Ana's superior Basic Attack range to consistently harass opponents in lane."]},{"name":"auriel","tips":["Sacred Sweep gives you good waveclear, and decent damage in team fights.
